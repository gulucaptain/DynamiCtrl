## üéè Abstract
<b>TL; DR: <font color="red">DynamiCtrl</font> is the first framework to introduce text to the human image animation task and achieve pose control within the MM-DiT architecture.</b>

<details><summary>CLICK for the full abstract</summary>


> Human image animation has recently gained significant attention due to advancements in generative models. However, existing methods still face two major challenges: (1) architectural limitations‚Äîmost models rely on U-Net, which underperforms compared to the MM-DiT; and (2) the neglect of textual information, which can enhance controllability. In this work, we introduce <font color="red">DynamiCtrl</font>, a novel framework that not only explores different pose-guided control structures in MM-DiT, but also reemphasizes the crucial role of text in this task. Specifically, we employ a Shared VAE encoder for both reference images and driving pose videos, eliminating the need for an additional pose encoder and simplifying the overall framework. To incorporate pose features into the full attention blocks, we propose Pose-adaptive Layer Norm (PadaLN), which utilizes adaptive layer normalization to encode sparse pose features. The encoded features are directly added to the visual input, preserving the spatiotemporal consistency of the backbone while effectively introducing pose control into MM-DiT. Furthermore, within the full attention mechanism, we align textual and visual features to enhance controllability. By leveraging text, we not only enable fine-grained control over the generated content, but also, for the first time, achieve simultaneous control over both background and motion. Experimental results verify the superiority of DynamiCtrl on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its strong identity preservation, heterogeneous character driving, background controllability, and high-quality synthesis. The source code will be made publicly available soon.

## ‚öîÔ∏è DynamiCtrl Human Motion Video Generation

### Background Control (contains long video performance)

We first refocus on the role of text for this task and find that fine-grained textual information helps improve video quality. In particular, we can achieve <font color="green">background controllability</font> using different prompts.

The identities of the digital human are generated by vivo's BlueLM model (image generation).

Two steps to generate a digital human:

1. Prepare a human image and a guided pose video, and generate the video materials using our DynamiCtrl.

2. Use the output video and an audio file, and apply MuseTalk to generate the correct lip movements.
